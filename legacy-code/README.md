# Financial Data
Small framework that takes your portfolio from degiro, and gets the actual and expected values as well as the recommendations from either WSJ or cincodias (if spanish stock) public webpages.

In order to get the framework running, change the config_template to your username and password, and rename it config.

Three parts are defined, that are relatively independent to one antoher:

## 1. Retrieve Portfolio and check from where to look for updated information:

Can be ran through portfolio.py, with the following options:

	-d: Download information from deGIRO platform
	-u: For each item, find the links from where the information can be retrieved
	-b: To do both functionalities.

## 2. Get information on forecast and recommendations, to compare with actual data:

Run getStonkValues.py (Currently no options avaialble)

	-o: Only the mentionned symbol (mainly for testing purposes)	     


## 3. Plot the information:

	pip install plotly	     
	pip install yfinance

  		a) Current price and the max/min for the last 52 weeks is shown together with the expectated 12 month value and the BEP
  		b) Diagrams "expert" buying/selling recommendations for each of the stocks are shown. 

	-s: Show current price for each product (-s).
