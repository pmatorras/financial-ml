# Results: S&P 500 Stock Selection Model

## Executive Summary

Built a machine learning pipeline to predict monthly S&P 500 stock returns using fundamental, technical, and regime-based features. After systematic testing of 8 model architectures and 7 feature engineering experiments, the final Random Forest model achieves:

**Portfolio Performance (Out-of-Sample, 2015-2025):**
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.93
- Annual Return: 20.2%
- Max Drawdown: -22.9%
- Alpha vs Random: 1.72%


> Simple models (Random Forest) were found to outperform complex methods (gradient boosting) by 18% in weak-signal regimes. Test AUC poorly predicts portfolio performance; probability distribution and regime awareness matter more.

### Model Hyperparameters

```python
RandomForestClassifier(
n_estimators=50,
max_depth=3,
max_features='log2',
min_samples_split=0.02,
min_samples_leaf=0.01,
class_weight='balanced',
random_state=42
)
```

### Training Configuration

**Time-series cross-validation:** 3-fold walk-forward validation

| Fold | Training Period | Test Period | Train Duration | Test Duration |
|------|-----------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| 1 | Jun 2010 - Sep 2016 | Nov 2016 - Oct 2019 | 6.3 years | 3.0 years |
| 2 | Jun 2010 - Sep 2019 | Nov 2019 - Oct 2022 | 9.3 years | 3.0 years |
| 3 | Jun 2010 - Sep 2022 | Nov 2022 - Oct 2025 | 12.3 years | 3.0 years |

**Method:** Expanding window walk-forward validation. Each fold adds 3 years of training data while preserving temporal order to prevent data leakage.

**Total out-of-fold predictions:** Nov 2016 - Oct 2025 (9 years)

**Portfolio Construction:** 
- Selection: Top 10% of monthly predictions (approximately 50 stocks)
- Weighting: Equal-weighted within selection
- Rebalancing: Monthly
- Smoothing: 3-month rolling window to reduce turnover
- Transaction costs: 0.19% per trade (bid-ask spread + commissions)

>**Rationale:** Smoothing reduces transaction costs while maintaining responsiveness to model signals. Without smoothing, monthly turnover would be ~ 30-40%; with 3-month smoothing, turnover reduces to ~15-20%.

## Model Comparison

Systematic testing of 7 model architectures:

| Rank | Model | Test AUC | Portfolio Sharpe | Decision |
|------|-------|----------|------------------|----------|
| 1 | **Random Forest** | 0.525 | **0.93** | **Selected** |
| 2 | RF Calibrated | 0.526 | 0.79 | Rejected |
| 3 | LightGBM | 0.526 | 0.77 | Rejected |
| 4 | Gradient Boosting | 0.526 | 0.81 | Rejected |
| 5 | XGBoost | 0.524 | 0.78 | Rejected |
| 6 | Logistic L2 | 0.512 | 0.79 | Rejected |
| 7 | Logistic L1 | 0.509 | 0.75 | Rejected |



### Model Correlation Matrix

![Model Correlation](images/correlation_matrix.png)

**Key observations:**
- Boosting models highly correlated (XGBoost/GB: 0.914) - learning similar weak patterns
- Random Forest provides unique signal (0.42-0.58 correlation with linear models)
- No good ensemble candidates (high correlation or weak individual performance)
- LightGBM highly correlated with RF (0.911) but much worse portfolio performance

### Critical Finding: Test AUC Does Not Predict Portfolio Performance

LightGBM achieved highest test AUC (0.526) but worst portfolio alpha (0.20%). Random Forest achieved best portfolio performance despite middle-tier AUC.

**Why this happens:**
- AUC measures ranking across all probability thresholds
- Portfolio construction selects top 10% only (single extreme threshold)
- Boosting models compress probabilities toward 0.50 due to heavy regularization
- RF maintains wider probability spread (0.43-0.64 vs 0.47-0.58 for boosting)
- At extremes, small probability differences matter greatly

**Lesson:** Optimise for portfolio metrics, not just validation metrics. Probability distribution quality matters more than average ranking quality in weak-signal regimes.

## Feature Engineering Experiments

| Experiment | Test AUC | Sharpe | Decision |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|
| Baseline (12 features) | 0.519 | 0.92 | Strong baseline |
| + VIX_percentile | **0.525** | **0.93** | **Adopted** |
| + VIX interactions | 0.527 | 0.86 | Probability compression |
| + Sentiment features | 0.521 | 0.87 | Noisy signal |
| Calibrated probabilities | 0.519 | 0.89 | Lost regime awareness |

**Key learning:** Simple regime indicator (VIX percentile) outperforms complex interactions. Feature engineering for portfolios requires maintaining probability spread, not just improving AUC.

---

## Why Random Forest Won

### 1. Optimal for Weak Signals

With test AUC 0.525 (only 2.5% above random), signal-to-noise ratio is extremely low:

**Random Forest (bagging):**
- Independent parallel trees
- Noise cancels through averaging
- Signal accumulates
- Probability spread: 0.214 (healthy)

**Gradient Boosting:**
- Sequential learning
- Chases noise in weak-signal regime
- Heavy regularization compresses probabilities
- Probability spread: 0.111 (too narrow)

### 2. Simple Beats Complex

| Complexity | Model | Sharpe | Training Time |
|------------|-------|--------|---------------|
| Simple | Random Forest | 0.93 | Fast |
| Complex | XGBoost | 0.80 | Medium |
| Complex | LightGBM | 0.78 | Fast |
| Complex | GradientBoosting | 0.84 | Medium |

More complex models add overfitting risk without discovering new signal.

### 3. Robustness Across Regimes

Cross-validation standard deviation:
- Random Forest: 0.011 (most stable)
- XGBoost: 0.007 (stable but poor performance)
- LightGBM: 0.010
- Gradient Boosting: 0.016 (least stable)

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Weak signal:** Test AUC 0.525 indicates limited predictive power
2. **Survivorship bias:** Trained only on current S&P 500 constituents (historical membership changes not modelled)
3. **Transaction costs:** 0.19% assumption may be optimistic for less liquid stocks
4. **Market impact:** Not modelled (assumes small capital base)
5. **Single model:** One model for all market regimes (no regime-specific models)

### Potential Improvements

**Better features:**
- Analyst revisions (earnings estimate changes)
- Short interest (sentiment proxy)
- Industry momentum (sector effects)
- Options implied volatility (forward-looking risk)

**Possible enhancements:**
- Include more granular (weekly-daily data)
- Include pre EDGAR fundamentals to cover 2008 financial crisis
- Regime-specific models (high-VIX vs low-VIX trained separately)
- Dynamic feature selection based on market conditions
- Alternative portfolio construction (mean-variance optimization, risk parity)

**Data quality:**
- Fix survivorship bias (full S&P 500 historical membership)
- Corporate action handling (splits, dividends, spinoffs)
- Point-in-time data validation (prevent look-ahead bias)
