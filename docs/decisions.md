## 1. Model Choice: Random Forest (Calibrated)

### Decision: Use calibrated Random Forest as final model

### Why Random Forest Over Logistic Regression?
1. **Better performance**
    - RF test AUC: 0.557 vs LogReg 0.558 (similar)
    - RF Sharpe: 0.71 vs LogReg ~0.65 (better)

2. **Captures non-linearities**
    - Stock returns are not linear in factors
    - Interactions matter (e.g., value works differently in small vs large caps)

3. **Robust to outliers**
    - Tree-based models less sensitive to extreme values
    - No need for extensive outlier treatment

### Why Constrained (max_depth=3)?
1. **Prevents overfitting**
    - Deep trees: Test AUC drops to 0.52
    - Shallow trees: Generalize better

2. **Interpretability**
    - Depth=3 means max 8 leaf nodes per tree
    - Easier to understand decision boundaries

### Why Calibration?
1. **Fixed miscalibrated probabilities**
    - Original: mean 0.487 (predicting only 5.7% beat SPY)
    - Calibrated: mean 0.502 (proper interpretation)

2. **Improved performance**
    - Sharpe: 0.71 → 0.80 (+13%)
    - Better discrimination (std 0.035 → 0.059)

3. **Industry standard**
    - Isotonic calibration is well-established
    - Preserves ranking

---

## 2. Ensemble: Rejected

### Decision: Do NOT use ensemble (LogReg + RF)

### Why Not Ensemble?
1. **Underperformed single model:**
    - Ensemble Sharpe: 0.71 vs RF_cal 0.80 → Weaker model dragged down performance

2. **Correlation too high (0.556)** → Models captured similar patterns


### Key Learning:
**Ensembles work when:**
- Models have similar performance
- Low correlation (<0.5)
- Capture truly different patterns

**Our case:**
- RF_cal clearly superior
- Moderate correlation (not enough diversity)

**Conclusion: Use best single model**

---

## 3. Smoothing: 3-Month Window

### Decision: Apply 3-month rolling average to predictions

### Problem:
Raw predictions were found to be volatile month-to-month (5.18% mean change)


**→ Move to a 3-month window:** 

### Rationale:
1. **Reduces noise without losing signal**
    - 58.7% reduction in volatility
    - Sharpe maintained at 0.80

2. **Lowers transaction costs**
    - Turnover: 50% → 42%
    - Cost drag: 1.0% → 0.82%

3. **Smoother returns**
    - Less month-to-month volatility  (1.93% mean change) in portfolio
    - Better investor experience

4. **Align the information to fundamentals**


### Implementation:

```bash
df['y_prob_smooth'] = df.groupby('ticker')['y_prob'].rolling(3, min_periods=1).mean()

```

---

## 4. Time Series CV: Expanding Window

### Decision: Use expanding window (not sliding window)

### Why Expanding?
1. **Uses all available data**
    - Later folds have more training data
    - Better estimates as time progresses

2. **More realistic**
    - In production, you'd use all historical data
    - Mimics actual deployment

3. **Reduces variance**
    - More training data → stabler models
    - Fewer overfitting issues

### Why Not Sliding Window?
- Throws away old data
- Smaller training sets
- Less stable models over time

---


## 5. Transaction Costs: 10 bps

### Decision: Model 10 bps (0.1%) per trade

### Breakdown:
- Bid-ask spread: 5 bps (realistic for liquid S&P 500 stocks)
- Market impact: 5 bps (small orders, moderate liquidity)

### Rationale:
- **Conservative but realistic**
    - S&P 500 stocks are liquid
    - Institutional execution typically 5-15 bps

- **Sensitive to AUM**
    - Works for <$100M strategies
    - Larger funds would face higher costs

### Impact on Results:
- Gross alpha: ~3.0%
- Transaction costs: -0.82%
- **Net alpha: 2.18%** (still attractive)

---

## 6. Portfolio Strategy: 100% Long-Only

### Decision: Use 100% long-only strategy (NOT long-short or 130-30)

### Why Long-Only Over Long-Short?

**Long-short failed**:
- Spread between top and bottom 10%: only 0.09%/month
- Annual return: 0.54% (essentially zero)
- Problem: Both long and short picks have high correlation (0.95)
- Both groups ride the market up together

**Long-only works**:
- Annual return: 17.9%
- Sharpe ratio: 0.80
- Alpha: 2.29% (statistically significant)
- Beta: 1.01 (market-neutral exposure)

### Why Not 130-30?

**Tested 130-30 Strategy**:
- Annual return: 18.3% (+0.4% vs long-only)
- Sharpe ratio: 0.80 (identical)
- Max drawdown: -20.9% (marginally better)

**Conclusion**: Not worth the added complexity, real-world costs eliminate any edge:
- Short borrow fees: 0.5-2% annually
- Higher rebalancing frequency
- Short recall risk
- Margin requirements

### Root Cause Analysis

**Model captures market exposure, not cross-sectional alpha**:
- Top 10% outperform market by 0.2%/month
- Bottom 10% also underperforms market by 0.07%/month
- Correlation between longs and shorts: 0.95

**What this means**:
- Model is good at identifying stocks with positive beta
- Model is weak at differentiating winners from losers
- Alpha comes from market participation + modest selection edge

### Final Strategy

100% long-only with top 10% holdings:
- Captures market beta (~15.5% annual)
- Adds selection alpha (~2.3% annual)
- Total: 17.9% annual with Sharpe 0.80

## 7. Sentiment Features: VIX with Clipped Interactions

### Decision: Add VIX-based features with regime-aware interactions

### Configuration:

**3 VIX-related features (from 1 base feature):**

1. `VIX_percentile`: Rolling percentile rank (0-1 scale)
2. `mom121_x_VIX`: Momentum × VIX_percentile (clipped [0.25, 0.75])
3. `vol12_x_VIX`: Volatility × VIX_percentile (clipped [0.25, 0.75])

### Why Add VIX?

**Market sentiment matters for stock selection:**

- Momentum works differently in calm vs volatile markets
- Stock volatility signal stronger during high market volatility
- VIX captures market regime (calm, normal, stressed)


### Evolution: From 5 Features to 3

**Initial approach failed (5 VIX features):**

- Added: `VIX`, `VIX_log`, `VIX_change_1m`, `VIX_percentile`, `VIX_zscore`
- Result: +0.097 AUC but +122% variance (too unstable)
- Problem: Regime dependency (COVID extreme values broke model)

**Final approach succeeded (3 VIX features):**

- Simplified: Only `VIX_percentile` + 2 interactions variables
- Clipped: [0.25, 0.75] to reduce extreme regime effects
- Result: **+0.093 AUC with only +31% variance** (acceptable)


### Why Interactions Over Raw VIX?

**Interactions capture regime-dependent behavior:**

- `mom121 × VIX`: "Momentum matters more/less in volatile markets"
- `vol12 × VIX`: "Stock volatility signal amplified when market is volatile"

**Raw VIX features were redundant:**

- `VIX_log` and `VIX_change_1m` overlapped with vol12 (caused 28% importance drop)
- Interactions provide unique information without redundancy


### Why Clip to [0.25, 0.75]?

**Tested 4 clip ranges:**


| Clip Range | AUC | Variance | Trade-off |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| [0.2, 0.8] | 0.5310 | 0.0142 | High performance, higher variance |
| **[0.25, 0.75]** | **0.5303** | **0.0123** | **Best balance**  |
| [0.3, 0.7] | 0.5280 | 0.0122 | Overconstrained |

**[0.25, 0.75] chosen because:**

1. Only -0.007 vs best performance
2. 13% lower variance than wider clip
3. Reduces regime range from 10x to 3x (stable across folds)
4. Still captures high/low VIX regimes (just dampened extremes)

### Performance Impact:

| Metric | Without VIX | With VIX | Improvement |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Test AUC | 0.5210 | **0.5303** | **+0.093**  |
| Variance | 0.0094 | 0.0123 | +31% (acceptable) |
| Fold 1 (calm 2016-19) | 0.517 | 0.527 | +0.010 |
| Fold 2 (COVID 2019-22) | 0.512 | 0.517 | +0.005 |
| Fold 3 (elevated 2022-25) | 0.534 | 0.547 | +0.013 |

### Why NOT Use rf_cal?

**rf_cal performed worse than base rf:**

- rf_cal test AUC: 0.5200 (baseline) → 0.5307 (with VIX)
- rf test AUC: 0.5210 (baseline) → **0.5303 (with VIX)** 

**Calibration hurt performance:**

- Added cv=3 layer reduced effective training data
- With weak signal (AUC ~0.53), calibration overfits to noise
- For stock ranking (not probability estimation), calibration unnecessary


**Result:** Stable improvement across all market conditions (+0.093) with controlled variance increase.

## 8. Random Forest Hyperparameters: 

### Final Configuration:

```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=50,
    max_depth=3,
    min_samples_split=100,
    min_samples_leaf=50,
    max_features='log2',
    max_samples=None,
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1,
    class_weight="balanced"
)
```


### Systematic Optimization Process

Tested 13 configurations across 4 phases:

**Phase 1 - Tree Depth:**

- Tested: depth $\in$ {3, 4, 5}
- Result: Depth 3 best (0.527 test AUC)
- Why deeper failed: Overfitting (gap increased 0.059 → 0.084)

**Phase 2 - Feature Sampling:**

- Tested: max_features $\in$ {log2, sqrt, 0.3, 0.4}
- Result: log2 best (0.527 test AUC, std 0.007)
- Why more features failed: Reduced tree diversity, hurt COVID fold

**Phase 3 - Ensemble Size:**

- Tested: n_estimators $\in$ {50, 100, 200}
- Result: 50 best (0.527 test AUC)
- Why more trees failed: Over-averaged weak signal

**Phase 4 - Bootstrap Sampling:**

- Tested: max_samples $\in$ {None, 0.9, 0.8}
- Result: None (100%) best (0.527 test AUC)
- Why subsampling failed: Removed data from already-weak signal


### Why Defaults Were Already Optimal

**1. Configuration matched problem characteristics:**

- Weak signal → shallow trees needed (depth 3)
- Limited data → full bootstrap needed (max_samples=None)
- Regime changes → high tree diversity needed (log2 features)

**2. Original tuning was conservative:**

- max_depth=3: Very shallow (only 8 leaf nodes max)
- max_features='log2': Only 26% of features per split
- These choices naturally regularize against overfitting

**3. Weak signal is self-limiting:**
With AUC ~0.53 (barely above random 0.50), the model can't overfit much:

- Not enough signal to memorize
- Regularization built into weak patterns


### Performance Validation

All alternatives either:

- **Worse test AUC** (depth 4-5, n_estimators 100-200, max_samples 0.8-0.9)
- **Higher variance** (max_features 0.4: std doubled to 0.014)
- **Worse generalization** (all deeper/complex configs had higher train-test gap)

| Config | Test AUC | Change | Test Std | Change |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Baseline** | **0.527** | — | **0.007** | — |
| depth=4 | 0.525 | -0.002 | 0.005 | -0.002 |
| max_features=0.4 | 0.529 | +0.002 | 0.014 | +0.007 |
| n_estimators=100 | 0.526 | -0.001 | 0.005 | -0.002 |
| max_samples=0.8 | 0.523 | -0.004 | 0.006 | -0.001 |

None worth changing: gains minimal or offset by worse stability.

### Key Principle: Simplicity with Weak Signals

**General ML wisdom:** More complexity → better performance (until overfitting)

**With weak signals (AUC < 0.55):**

- More complexity → worse performance (immediately overfits)
- Simpler models generalize better
- Default regularization often already optimal

**These results confirmed this:**

- Every complexity increase hurt performance
- Simplest config (baseline) was best

## 9. VIX Sentiment Feature: Simple Over Complex

### Decision: Add only VIX_percentile (no interactions, no calibration)

### Final Configuration:

```python
# features.py
def calculate_sentiment_features(sentiment_data):
    vix = sentiment_data['VIX']
    vix_percentile = vix.rolling(12, min_periods=3).rank(pct=True)
    return {'VIX_percentile': vix_percentile}

# No interactions - RF learns them naturally
def calculate_vix_interactions(market_features, sentiment_features, tickers):
    return {}

# definitions.py
model = 'rf'  # Use base RF, NOT rf_cal
total_features = 13  # 12 base + 1 VIX_percentile
```


### Why Add VIX?

**Market regime affects stock selection:**

- Calm markets (VIX < 15): Value and momentum work well
- Volatile markets (VIX > 30): Quality and defensive factors dominate
- VIX_percentile (12-month rolling rank) captures relative volatility

**Empirical evidence:**

- Test AUC improved: 0.519 → 0.526 (+0.007)
- Portfolio Sharpe improved: 0.92 → 0.93 (+0.01)
- All time periods benefited, especially COVID (+0.007)

***

### Why NOT Interactions?

**Tested multiplicative interactions:**

```python
# What we tested (and rejected)
mom121_x_VIX = mom121 * VIX_percentile
vol12_x_VIX = vol12 * VIX_percentile
```

**Results:**


| Metric | VIX Only | VIX + Interactions | Difference |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Test AUC | 0.526 | 0.527 | +0.001 (minimal) |
| Portfolio Sharpe | **0.93** | 0.86 | **-0.07**  |
| Alpha vs Random | **1.72%** | 0.44% | **-1.28%**  |
| Annual Return | **20.2%** | 18.9% | **-1.3%**  |

**Why interactions failed:**

1. **Probability compression**
    - VIX only: [0.43, 0.64] range = 0.21
    - Interactions: [0.42, 0.65] range = 0.23 (similar)
    - But interactions **destroyed signal at extremes**
2. **Forced functional form**
    - Multiplication assumes specific relationship
    - Random Forest can learn **better interactions naturally**
    - Tree splits like: "If VIX_percentile > 0.7 AND mom121 < 0 → Strong sell"
    - More flexible than fixed multiplication
3. **Over-regularization**
    - Interactions made model overly cautious
    - Lost conviction in top picks
    - Top 10% selection needs extreme probabilities
4. **Failed where it should help**
    - 2022 Bear Market drawdown: -22.9% (VIX only) vs -24.4% (interactions)
    - VIX interactions **worse** in the period they should protect

***

### Why NOT Calibration?

**Tested: rf_cal with VIX_percentile**

**Results:**


| Metric | rf + VIX | rf_cal + VIX | Difference |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Portfolio Sharpe | **0.93** | 0.79 | **-0.14**  |
| Alpha vs Random | **1.72%** | **-0.69%** | **-2.41%**  |
| Annual Return | **20.2%** | 17.8% | **-2.4%**  |

**rf_cal actually LOSES to random stock picking!**

**Why calibration failed with VIX:**

1. **Regime-dependent distributions**
    - Calm markets: Different probability distribution than volatile markets
    - Calibration fits **single average curve**
    - Doesn't account for regime shifts
2. **Stretched probabilities mislead selection**
    - Calibration: [0.28, 0.82] range (looks good!)
    - But stretched values don't correlate with regime-specific returns
    - Makes wrong stocks look good in wrong regimes
3. **Baseline calibration worked**
    - No sentiment: rf_cal had 0.92 Sharpe (tied best)
    - With VIX: rf_cal drops to 0.79 Sharpe (worst)
    - VIX breaks calibration assumptions

**Principle:** Calibration assumes **stationary distribution**. Regime features (VIX) create **non-stationary distributions** where calibration misleads.

***

### Why VIX_percentile Specifically?

**Tested alternatives:**

- `VIX` (raw level): Too noisy, regime-dependent thresholds
- `VIX_log`: Non-linear transform, no benefit
- `VIX_change_1m`: Too reactive, adds noise

**VIX_percentile advantages:**

1. **Bounded **: Always interpretable
2. **Relative measure**: "High/low compared to past year"
3. **Stable**: 12-month window smooths daily noise
4. **Regime indicator**:
    - < 0.3 = Calm period
    - 0.3-0.7 = Normal
    - > 0.7 = Volatile period
5. **Works across time**:
    - VIX=15 in 2017 (high) → percentile 0.8
    - VIX=15 in 2020 (low) → percentile 0.2
    - Captures **relative** not absolute volatility

***

### Performance Comparison

| Configuration | Test AUC | Sharpe | Return | Alpha | Verdict |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **VIX_percentile only** | **0.526** | **0.93** | **20.2%** | **1.72%** | **Optmimal**  |
| No sentiment | 0.519 | 0.92 | 20.2% | 1.70% | Baseline |
| VIX + interactions | 0.527 | 0.86 | 18.9% | 0.44% | Failed |
| rf_cal + VIX | 0.526 | 0.79 | 17.8% | -0.69% | Disaster |

**Winner is clear:** Single VIX_percentile feature beats all alternatives.

***

### Key Principle: Let the Model Learn

**What we learned:**

-  Engineered interactions: Impose assumptions, limit flexibility
-  Simple features: Model discovers optimal interactions

**Random Forest strength:**

- Naturally learns non-linear relationships
- Discovers feature interactions through tree splits
- No need to manually specify functional forms



***

### Risk: Why Not Remove VIX Entirely?

One Could argue that Baseline (no VIX) had 0.92 Sharpe, final has 0.93 - barely different!

**Why we keep VIX_percentile:**

1. **Test AUC improved** (0.519 → 0.526)
    - More robust ranking
    - Less overfitting to specific periods
2. **All periods benefited:**
    - Bull 2016-19: 0.515 → 0.516
    - COVID 2019-22: 0.512 → 0.519 (+0.007!)
    - Recovery 2022-25: 0.535 → 0.542 (+0.007!)
3. **Better downside protection:**
    - Max drawdown: -23.0% → -22.9%
    - 2022 bear: -23.0% → -22.9%
4. **Future-proofing:**
    - Next crisis will have extreme VIX
    - Model explicitly regime-aware
    - Not just lucky on historical data
5. **Statistical significance:**
    - Both pass Sharpe significance tests (p < 0.001)
    - But VIX model has better metrics across board

**Cost:** 1 additional feature (13 vs 12)
**Benefit:** Improved AUC + regime awareness + better drawdowns

**Risk-reward:** Strongly favors keeping VIX_percentile.

***

### Implementation Notes

**Data requirement:**

- VIX data availability: 1995-present
- Training data starts: 2016-11-30 (earliest with all features)
- Full 9-year backtest available

**Computational cost:**

- Negligible (1 extra feature)
- Rolling percentile fast to compute
- No complex interactions to calculate

**Maintenance:**

- VIX data updated daily (public, reliable)
- No calibration needed (use raw RF probabilities)
- Feature calculation stable across time

***

## Summary: Simple Features + Powerful Models

**Rejected approaches:**

-  Complex interactions (mom121 × VIX, vol12 × VIX)
-  Calibration (rf_cal)
-  Multiple VIX transforms (log, changes)

**Winning approach:**

-  Single feature: VIX_percentile
-  Let Random Forest learn interactions
-  Use uncalibrated probabilities

**Result:** Best Sharpe (0.93), improved AUC (+0.007), robust across all regimes.

## 10. Model Selection: Random Forest Over Gradient Boosting

### Decision: Use Random Forest, reject all boosting methods

### Rationale

After systematic testing of multiple model architectures, Random Forest emerged as the clear winner for our weak-signal stock prediction problem (test AUC around 0.52).

### Models Tested

We evaluated five model types:

1. Random Forest (bagging)
2. Logistic Regression (linear baseline)
3. XGBoost (gradient boosting)
4. LightGBM (gradient boosting, leaf-wise)
5. sklearn GradientBoosting (gradient boosting with early stopping)

### Comparison Results

| Model | Test AUC | Portfolio Alpha vs Random | Portfolio Sharpe |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Random Forest | 0.525 | 1.72% | 0.93 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.519 | 1.70% | 0.92 |
| sklearn GradientBoosting | 0.526 | 0.80% | ~0.84 |
| XGBoost | 0.524 | 0.41% | ~0.80 |
| LightGBM | 0.526 | 0.20% | ~0.78 |

### Why Random Forest Won

**1. Optimal for Weak Signals**

With test AUC around 0.52, signal-to-noise ratio is extremely low. Random Forest's bagging approach (parallel independent trees) naturally handles this:

- Noise cancels out through averaging
- Signal accumulates across trees
- No risk of amplifying noise (unlike sequential boosting)

**2. Healthy Probability Spread**

Portfolio construction requires conviction at extremes (top 10% selection):


| Model | Probability Range | Top 10% Conviction |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Random Forest | 0.214 (0.43-0.64) | Strong (0.05 spread) |
| XGBoost | 0.111 (0.49-0.60) | Weak (0.015 spread) |
| LightGBM | 0.111 (0.47-0.58) | Very weak (0.02 spread) |

Boosting models compressed probabilities toward 0.50 despite heavy regularization, destroying their ability to select winners.

**3. Best Train-Test Generalization**


| Model | Train AUC | Test AUC | Gap |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Random Forest | 0.587 | 0.525 | 0.062 |
| sklearn GB | 0.591 | 0.526 | 0.065 |
| XGBoost | 0.594 | 0.524 | 0.070 |
| LightGBM | 0.594 | 0.526 | 0.068 |

RF has the smallest gap, indicating best generalization.

**4. Stable Across Market Regimes**

Cross-validation standard deviation:

- Random Forest: 0.011
- XGBoost: 0.007 (more stable but worse performance)
- LightGBM: 0.010
- sklearn GB: 0.016 (least stable)

RF balances stability with performance.

### Why Boosting Failed

**1. Sequential Learning Amplifies Noise**

Gradient boosting builds trees sequentially, each correcting "errors" of previous trees:

- With weak signal, most "errors" are noise, not missed patterns
- Sequential correction chases noise
- Heavy regularization required to prevent overfitting
- But regularization compresses probabilities

**2. Regularization Paradox**

To control overfitting, we applied:

- Very low learning rate (0.01)
- Strong L1/L2 penalties
- Large minimum samples per leaf
- Early stopping

This successfully reduced train-test gap but:

- Compressed probabilities toward 0.50
- Destroyed conviction in extreme predictions
- Made top 10% selection nearly random

**3. LightGBM's Leaf-Wise Growth**

LightGBM grows trees leaf-wise (picks best leaf to split):

- More aggressive than level-wise growth
- Optimal for strong signals
- Catastrophic for weak signals (AUC 0.526, alpha 0.20%)

**4. Test AUC Misleading**

LightGBM achieved highest test AUC (0.526) but worst portfolio alpha (0.20%). This demonstrates:

- AUC measures ranking across all thresholds
- Portfolio selects at single extreme threshold
- Performance at extremes >> average ranking quality


### Alternative Considered: Ensembling

High RF-LightGBM correlation (0.911) suggested LightGBM adds noise, not complementary signal. Ensembling would not help.

Lower RF-XGBoost correlation (0.576) suggests different patterns, but those patterns perform poorly (0.41% alpha).

No ensemble combination improves upon RF alone.

### Implementation Advantages of RF

**1. Simplicity**

- No learning rate tuning
- No regularization parameter selection
- Fewer hyperparameters to optimize

**2. Interpretability**

- Feature importance straightforward
- No sequential dependencies to trace
- Each tree independently interpretable

**3. Training Speed**

- Parallel tree construction
- Faster than boosting for same number of trees

**4. Robustness**

- No risk of gradient explosion
- No early stopping to monitor
- Consistent behavior across runs


### When Boosting Would Be Better

Gradient boosting excels when:

- Strong signal (AUC > 0.65)
- Large training set (> 1M samples)
- Complex non-linear patterns
- Tabular data competitions (Kaggle)

None apply to our case:

- Weak signal (AUC 0.52)
- Moderate data (100k samples)
- Linear and simple interactions dominate
- Production system (not competition)


### Final Configuration

```python

Total features: 13 (12 base + VIX_percentile)

Performance:

- Test AUC: 0.525
- Portfolio Sharpe: 0.93
- Alpha vs random: 1.72%
- Train-test gap: 0.062


### Risk Assessment

**Low risk decision:**

- Tested 5 model types systematically
- Random Forest superior on all metrics that matter (portfolio performance)
- Boosting failed by large margins (54-88% worse alpha)
- Unlikely that further boosting optimization closes this gap

**Confidence level:** High. Extensive testing confirms RF is optimal for this problem.

## 11. Models Not Tested and Why

### Decision: Did not test neural networks, SVM, or other complex models

After systematically testing five model types (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, sklearn GradientBoosting), we concluded that further model architecture exploration would not improve results. This section documents why additional model types were considered but not tested.

***

### Neural Networks (MLP, TabNet, Deep Learning)

**Why not tested:**

1. **Signal too weak:** Test AUC around 0.52 indicates minimal predictive signal. Neural networks excel when strong patterns exist (AUC > 0.70), not for near-random prediction tasks.
2. **Dataset too small:** Approximately 100k samples across 500 stocks and 200 months. Neural networks require 1M+ samples to avoid overfitting. Academic research shows tree-based methods dominate on tabular datasets with fewer than 500k samples.
3. **Boosting already failed:** Gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, GradientBoosting) shares key characteristics with neural networks: complex hypothesis space, prone to overfitting weak signals, requires heavy regularization. All three boosting methods performed poorly (alpha 0.20-0.80% vs RF's 1.72%). Neural networks would likely fail for the same reasons.
4. **Probability compression risk:** Neural networks require careful regularization (dropout, weight decay) to prevent overfitting. This regularization compresses probabilities toward 0.50, exactly the problem that destroyed boosting performance. Portfolio construction requires strong conviction at extremes (top 10% selection).
5. **Complexity cost:** Neural networks require extensive hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, architecture, batch size, dropout), proper cross-validation, feature scaling, and careful calibration. Expected time investment: 8-20 hours for minimal expected improvement.

**Literature support:** "Tabular data: Deep learning is not all you need" (2021) and "Why do tree-based models still outperform deep learning on tabular data?" (2022) demonstrate tree-based methods outperform neural networks on small/medium tabular datasets, especially with weak signals.

**Expected outcome if tested:** Test AUC 0.50-0.53, portfolio alpha 0.3-1.0%, worse than Random Forest. Not worth the time investment.

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

**Why not tested:**

1. **Training time:** SVMs scale poorly with dataset size. Training time is O(n²) to O(n³), making them 10-100x slower than tree-based methods on our 100k sample dataset.
2. **Weak signal performance:** SVMs perform best on linearly separable or clearly non-linear problems with strong signals. Our near-random prediction task (AUC 0.52) doesn't favor SVM's maximum margin approach.
3. **Probability calibration:** SVMs don't naturally output probabilities. Platt scaling required for calibration often produces poor probability estimates, especially for weak signals.
4. **Hyperparameter sensitivity:** Kernel selection (linear, RBF, polynomial), regularization (C parameter), and kernel parameters (gamma) require extensive tuning with uncertain payoff.

**Expected outcome if tested:** Test AUC 0.50-0.52, portfolio alpha 0.5-1.2%, training time 5-10x slower than Random Forest. Poor time investment.

***

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**Why not tested:**

1. **Curse of dimensionality:** Performance degrades rapidly with increasing dimensions. With 13 features, distance metrics become unreliable (all points approximately equidistant in high dimensions).
2. **No probability estimates:** KNN outputs class proportions among neighbors, not true probabilities. Poor for portfolio construction requiring confident probability estimates.
3. **Computational cost:** Prediction requires computing distances to all training samples. Slow for production deployment.

**Expected outcome if tested:** Test AUC 0.48-0.51 (likely worse than random), poor probability calibration.

***

### Naive Bayes

**Why not tested:**

Independence assumption violated. Financial features (momentum, value, quality) are correlated by construction. Naive Bayes performs poorly when features depend on each other.

**Expected outcome if tested:** Test AUC 0.49-0.51, unreliable probability estimates.

***

### ExtraTrees (Extremely Randomized Trees)

**Considered but not tested:**

ExtraTrees is similar to Random Forest but uses random splits instead of optimal splits. This could theoretically provide even better noise resistance. However:

1. **Low expected improvement:** RF already near-optimal (Sharpe 0.93, alpha 1.72%). ExtraTrees typically performs within 1-2% of RF on similar tasks.
2. **Diminishing returns:** With weak signal (AUC 0.52), additional randomization unlikely to discover new patterns. More likely to add noise.
3. **Priority:** Feature engineering and portfolio optimization offer higher expected ROI than testing another tree ensemble variant.

**Future consideration:** If pursuing ensemble methods (averaging multiple models), ExtraTrees could provide diversity from Random Forest. Current single-model approach makes this unnecessary.

### Summary: Why Further Testing Stopped

We tested representatives from major model families:

- Linear models: Logistic Regression (good baseline, 0.92 Sharpe)
- Bagging: Random Forest (best, 0.93 Sharpe)
- Boosting: 3 variants tested, all failed (0.78-0.84 Sharpe)

This covers the primary approaches for tabular classification. Additional architectures (neural networks, SVM, etc.) either:

1. Face same fundamental issues that caused boosting to fail (weak signal + overfitting)
2. Are theoretically unsuited for problem characteristics (small data, tabular features, weak signal)
3. Offer minimal expected improvement over current solution

**Conclusion:** Model architecture exploration completed. Further performance gains should come from feature engineering, portfolio optimization, or data quality improvements, not trying additional model types.
